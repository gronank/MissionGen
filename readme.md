## AirGoon Mission generation

### Description

This is a script that generates goon missions based on a mission template combined with the sign-up sheet. 

The idea is to use the mission editor to create the mission template with all the enemies, vehicles, refuelers and what-have-you. But this is not a good way of handling the less static and more fickle aspects of the mission. Of course, the most fickle aspect is the goons themselves, occasionally distracted by something they call 'life'. To make organizing a mission not a soul crushing experience, all the things that might get adjusted along the way such as participants and radio frequencies are added on top of the template to create the finished mission.
